# FarmhouseVisits
A mod that allows villagers to visit you.

## Features
- NPC blacklist
- Villagers can bring gifts.
- In-laws will ask about your spouse and children (if any).
- The visitor will walk around and comment on your furniture.
- Once the visit ends, the character either inform you or stay for a sleepover.
- Customizable start and end hours, along with chance for every 10 minutes and max visits per day.
- Visits can walk around your farm, sheds, and greenhouse (configurable).
- Scheduled visits (via CP patching of the schedule file).

## Scheduled visits
You can make characters visit you at any time you want- just edit `mistyspring.farmhousevisits/Schedules` via ContentPatcher. Because you're editing via CP, you can use conditions just fine.

For more information, see [here]().
